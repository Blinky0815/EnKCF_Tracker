YoungWoo:
1) Need to make a list of videos we'll be using for evaluation.
1)-1 all of UAV123 videos
1)-2 VOT2015
1)-3 OTB

2) Make other tracking algorithms available for producing results on
the selected videos. As of 17th, LCT, STC, Struck are ready, but DSST
has an issue of mex compilation.

Burak: 
1) Clean up the pseudo code on EnKCF and place at the beginning of the
technical section.
2) Complete the experiments asap

Try to get a complete draft, writing and experiments done by 21st

Might want to have several graphs where each of them focus on a
specific feature of an object tracking algorithm, e.g., scale,

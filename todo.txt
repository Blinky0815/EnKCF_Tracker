The plan of publishing this work is 

1) YoungWoo will continue to work on making a target-following
pipeline available. This pipeline includes a tracker, EnKCF, and
flight control module w/ a drone. This work will be submitted to any
of robotics conference at Fall 2017.

2) For BMVC submission, 

2)-1 If it gets accepted, we'll be working on a journal submission and
not working on submitting what YoungWoo is working on to any robotics
conference. The journal submission will include EnKCF and a
target-following pipeline.

2)-2 Otherwise, we'll be looking for other conferences to submit the
BMVC submission. Hopefully the time we're submitting the BMVC
submission to another conference, the contents of the paper are more
clear and better.

YoungWoo:
1) Go over the text and revise it asap,

Burak:
1) Refine/renew figures, Figure 2 and 3. Make Figure 4 and 5 more visible.
2) Make Algorithm 1 more readable.

YoungWoo:
1) Need to make a list of videos we'll be using for evaluation.
1)-1 all of UAV123 videos
1)-2 VOT2015
1)-3 OTB

2) Make other tracking algorithms available for producing results on
the selected videos. As of 17th, LCT, STC, Struck are ready, but DSST
has an issue of mex compilation.

Burak: 
1) Clean up the pseudo code on EnKCF and place at the beginning of the
technical section.
2) Complete the experiments asap

Try to get a complete draft, writing and experiments done by 21st

Might want to have several graphs where each of them focus on a
specific feature of an object tracking algorithm, e.g., scale,
